# Airline Passenger Forecasting with ARIMA and SARIMA Models
Overview
In this analysis, I tackled the challenge of forecasting airline passenger numbers using time series modeling techniques. To achieve this, I leveraged a fascinating dataset spanning from January 1949 to December 1960. Each data point represented the total number of passengers in thousands, offering valuable insights into historical travel trends.


**ARIMA:**
Order (p, d, q): Specify the values for AR, I, and MA terms.
Parameters: List estimated coefficients and their interpretations.

**SARIMA:**
Non-seasonal order (p, d, q): Same as ARIMA.
Seasonal order (P, D, Q, s): Specify seasonal AR, I, MA terms, and seasonality period.
Seasonal parameters: List estimated seasonal coefficients.

**Model Performance**:
